## Overview
This is a small project after learning in depth some concepts of the javascript language. I've created it so as to put the knowledge into practice because it's the way to acquire and really understand the things I've learned before. 
In this time, I chose a 'meet team' project to practice FETCH requests and async/await concepts that are really important in JS.
People in the cards of the project are inspired by the tv show: 'Silicon Valley'.

### The challenge
Basically consists in cards with each person of a tech project. The information of all of them is located in a JSON file (simulating an API) and the app needs to make a fetch request to get it. Then I managed the responses so as to show it fine. For the project I used my knowledge in HTML and CSS too.

## My process
I've chosen the idea by myself because I want to learn more about fetch & async/await to work with API's and do interesting projects. I thought about all the logic and managment using the concepts that I learned about. Then I styled the web with a minimalist view and I think it looks nice, I like it.

### Built with

- Mobile first workflow
- Responsive design
- Flexbox concepts
- Control version system using Git
- JavaScript vanilla

### What I learned
In this project I learned quite more than the previous (that's important) I used fetch requests and await/async functions so I achieved my goal with this one. I started without a clear idea, especially for the UI but then I had an idea and I was be able to get it.
I'll keep working and improving on it.

### Continued development
I'm really excited to keep learning about frontend technologies, specially more about javascript in order to create dynamic webs and amazing web-experiences.
